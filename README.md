# MEAN-Calendar
A simple restful Calendar app with AngularJS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB

This is an extension of the [To-do List App](https://github.com/altany/MEAN-ToDoApp) I created with the MEAN stack

### Demo
To see and play with this app, follow:
[https://mean-calendar.herokuapp.com](https://mean-calendar.herokuapp.com).

It is uploaded in Heroku so it might take some time to load the first time.

*To instal and run this app, [this blog](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/) is very useful*
